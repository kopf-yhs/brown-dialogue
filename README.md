Work in Progress. Credits to [ParlAI](http://parl.ai) and [rosewang2008](https://github.com/rosewang2008/language_modeling_via_stochastic_processes/) for open-sourcing their projects.

What's done:
- Load encoder & decoder checkpoints fine-tuned using [rosewang2008](https://github.com/rosewang2008/language_modeling_via_stochastic_processes/) and run inference (interactive) on ParlAI

TO-DO:
- Enable encoder & decoder training on ParlAI framework
